#### Possible Bugs
    * when user doesn't input the correct password length, ask the user the right input, 
    or design the interface that doesn't allow for such mistakes.
    
    * when user doesn't select any character set, provide a defult value.
    
    * when the password length is small and characters set is more than one, select atleast 
    one password from the character set.
